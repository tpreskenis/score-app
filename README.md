The follwing is a front end application built off of vue.  It uses a score api to get data from two games and then transform that into an easily accessable application.

## Project setup
The first thing you want to do is pull this repo.  Then once you are in the root, run the following:
```
npm install
```

From here you want to make sure you are running the Sports App API.  Once that is running then compile the application.
```
npm run serve
```
