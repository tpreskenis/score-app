The follwing is a front end application built off of vue.  It uses a score api to get data from two games and then transform that into an easily accessable application.  The application is also built around using an iPhone X with touch screen, but also works on desktop.

## Project setup
The first thing you want to do is pull this repo.  Then once you are in the root, run the following:
```
npm install
```

Once that is running then compile the application.
```
npm run serve
```

This repo is currently live at:
https://gentle-sea-03c17830f.azurestaticapps.net

Of course this website will only let you run with the Local option selected!

## API or Local
<div align="center">

If the API is not running, the application will ask you to either read from local files or download and run the API.
</div>

### If You Run Local
    1. Press the code icon.
    2. Press the refresh button on the top bar. 
    3. Make sure to wait a 10 seconds before you press the refresh button.
    

### If You Run With API
    1. Press the API icon.
    2. This will take you to the API Page
    3. You will need to request the Access URL as well as allow me to set up your location in MongoDB (https://github.com/tpreskenis/score-api)
    4. Once the API is running locally, you press the refresh button on the top bar.


## Roadmap

While the project is mainly done, I might come back and update.  Currently the pictures are pulling from ESPN and the Vue componets can be consolidated.

Feel free to use the componets and mix it up!  Excited to see what people can build with this as a base.  Or just use it to get ideas!
